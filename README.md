# Object-Detection-and-Classfication

- Constructing YOLO-v3 and FPN networks to reailze object detection and recognition.
- Limited by computing resource, I finetuning the network on the basis of pretraining models. Expirements show that on classification task, compared with YOLO FPN has a tiny improvement in accuracy, especially for the small objects. While YOLO has a faster speed of training and detection.
